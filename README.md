# ClaudeWarp

A native macOS app that proxies the Anthropic Messages API, letting you use any valid Claude Code subscription (or Bedrock) as an API backend. No separate API key needed. Just point your client at `http://localhost:8082/v1/messages` and you're done.

## What it does

ClaudeWarp runs as a menu bar app on macOS. It exposes a local Anthropic API-compatible endpoint that converts requests into headless `claude` calls. Any tool that speaks the Anthropic Messages API (LiteLLM, Open Interpreter, curl, whatever) can hit it and use whatever Claude Code subscription or Bedrock credentials you have configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Install

```bash
make install
```

This builds the app, copies it to `/Applications`, and fixes the macOS gatekeeper signature issue automatically.

## Use

1. Start ClaudeWarp from Applications or Spotlight
2. Set these environment variables in your client:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8082
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy
   ```
3. Point your client at the proxy and go

If the app won't run, you might need to manually clear the quarantine flag:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/ClaudeWarp.app"
```

## Build

```bash
make
```

Output: `build/ClaudeWarp.app`

## Clean

```bash
make clean
```

## Run (dev)

```bash
make run
```

Works with any Claude Code subscription plan or Bedrock setup. Settings are read from your existing `~/.claude/settings.json`.
